This is a collection of resources created by Beau Horenberger and Kirk Bonney for research on Siegel Paramodular forms under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung. The goal of this project is to compute coefficients of Siegel paramodular forms of weight 2 using a paper by Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung and Dr. Brooks Roberts.

In ComputationalAlgorithms, you will find a collection of programs which attempt to implement the process described in that paper. Some programs will attempt the whole process, and some are sub-algorithms based on smaller theoretical components of the process.

Goals:
  ASAP:
    Link all algorithms in the above folder to respective resources in the overview pdf (for clarity)
  Soon:
    Implement the representative calculator for arbitrary levels of the congruence subgroup (use projective plane)
    Create clear algorithm descriptions in the overview pdf
  Eventually:
    Create a complete coefficient calculator for case one of the paper's five cases
