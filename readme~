This is a collection of resources created by Beau Horenberger and Kirk Bonney for research on Siegel Paramodular forms under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung. The goal of this project is to compute coefficients of Siegel paramodular forms of weight 2 using a paper by Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung and Dr. Brooks Roberts.
